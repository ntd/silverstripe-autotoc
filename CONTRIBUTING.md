# Contributing

Any open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You
can participate by sharing code, ideas, or simply helping others. No
matter what your skill level is, every contribution counts.

The main developement is done in `dev`: that is merged into `master` when
considered stable enough. When this happens, an appropriate release is tagged.
`dev` and `master` branches are compatibles with SilverStripe 4. For
SilverStripe 3 you should take a look at the `ss3` branch.
