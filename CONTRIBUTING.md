# Contributing

Any open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You
can participate by sharing code, ideas, or simply helping others. No
matter what your skill level is, every contribution counts.

The main development happens into the `dev` branch, so pull requests are
expected to be done against `dev`. Anyway the project is so small that
contributions in master will not be surely rejected.
